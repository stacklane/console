# Collection of AppVersion's
#
# Case dependent as to whether an App *must* explicitly use versioning,
# as opposed to directly updating AppVersion#source
#
# AKA Repository, Source, Package, Module
#
# These can ultimately represent *anything* definable as Stacklane "source",
# including sites, apps, module (of models), connector, etc.
#
# App/AppVersion's themselves are not deployed --
# they are deployed only through a ProjectVersion association.
#
# Put differently, App/AppVersion's are "installed" into Project/ProjectVersion's.
#
# -----------------

# TBD it may make sense for an App to require an Org.
#   or at least it should be required before before the App was used by other Projects.
