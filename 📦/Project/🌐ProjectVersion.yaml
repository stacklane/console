# Describes the "content" of a "deployment"
#
# The "content" also includes: ProjectKey + ProjectInstanceKey
#
# AKA "Project Instance" or "Project Variation"
#
# For all intents and purpose this also represents an
# instance-of "source"
#
# ----------------

#
# If AppVersion is present, it contains the 'source of the source' (which may no longer match).
#
# The App itself may also have a later version available than this AppVersion.
#
# Critical: This ProjectVersion *should* duplicate any essential properties from the AppVersion.
#           This ProjectVersion should *not* require the AppVersion to continue to operate.
