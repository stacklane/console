# The "content" also includes: ProjectKey + ProjectInstanceKey

# If present, contains the 'source of the source' (and which may no longer match).
# The App itself may also have a later version available than this AppVersion.

#             The ProjectVersion should not require the AppVersion to continue to operate.
