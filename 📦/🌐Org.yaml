# Optional, overarching association for top-level models.
#
# Org's do NOT impact user-associations to the various top-level models.
#
# They primarily provide a higher level association that "runs through" various top-level models,
# without actually impacting user permissions / user associations.
#
# However an "OrgOwner" may have the ability to be a kind of super user for the
# the models associated with an Org -- meaning they could manage users associated with Org-associated models.
